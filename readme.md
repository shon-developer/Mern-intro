In backend our server interacts with our database then we execute some code on our server to create an application which then server to the client side. This will speed up your website and also keeps your business logic hidden

The commonly used technologies in the backend

- node.js
- ruby
- java
- php

  the main job of these frame work is to simply reduce the repetitive stuff the developer has to do. They have developers work by cutting down the ground work

# Nodejs

## Why node js

- node js runs on javascript
- make us capable of creating scalable and really fast running websites
- it takes js out of the browser, liberates it allowing to interact directly with the hardware of the computer
- we can also use nodejs to run js code in someone else's computer on rather a server
- means, a user can logg on to google and put in a query and the brower will make request to google servers and on those servers we can actually execute js code to process and after that run we can send back the result to the user or to the client and get the web browsers to display the information. All the heavy lifting and code execution happens behind the listen to network traffic and manipulate database

## companies using nodejs
